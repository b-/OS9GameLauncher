Game Launcher AppleScript for Mac OS 9 - Change Log
===================================================

**Version 1.0** - 04 July 2017 - First working version.

**Version 1.1** - 06 July 2017 - Added support for A-Dock (Mac OS X style dock for OS 9). A-Dock doesn't play well with some full screen games. The script check to see if A-Dock is running and quits it if so. After quitting the game the script will relaunch A-Dock.
